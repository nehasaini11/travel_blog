                        Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating 
                        durable images by recording light, either electronically by 
                        means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive 
                        material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields 
                        of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, 
                        as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, 
                        recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.

                        Videography is the process of capturing moving images on 
                        electronic media (e.g., videotape, direct to disk recording, or 
                        solid state storage) and even streaming media. The term includes 
                        methods of video production and post-production. It used to be 
                        considered the video equivalent of cinematography (moving images 
                        recorded on film stock), but the advent of digital video 
                        recording in the late 20th century blurred the distinction 
                        between the two, as in both methods the intermediary mechanism 
                        became the same. Nowadays, any video work could be called 
                        videography, whereas commercial motion picture production would 
                        be called cinematography.
